How to obtain a bunch of GitHub issues or pull requests with R
=================

I want to make [`purrr`](https://github.com/hadley/purrr) and [`dplyr`](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) and [`tidyr`](https://github.com/hadley/tidyr) play nicely with each other. How can I use `purrr` for iteration, while still using `dplyr` and `tidyr` to manage the data frame side of of the house?

Three motivating examples, where I marshal data from the GitHub API using the excellent [`gh` package](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/gh):

  * In [STAT 545](http://stat545-ubc.github.io), 10% of the course mark is awarded for engagement. I want to use contributions to the course [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues) as a primary input here. This is how I fell down this rabbit hole in the first place.
  * Oliver Keyes [tweeted](https://twitter.com/quominus/status/670398322696392705) that he wanted "a script that goes through all my GitHub repositories and generates a list of which ones have open issues". How could I resist this softball? Sure, there are [easier ways to do this](https://twitter.com/millerdl/status/670430991278858240), but why not use R?
  * Jordan Ellenberg, [writing for the Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-summers-most-unread-book-is-1404417569), used Amazon's "Popular Highlights" feature to define the **Hawking Index**:
  
    > Take the page numbers of a book's five top highlights, average them, and divide by the number of pages in the whole book. The higher the number, the more of the book we're guessing most people are likely to have read.
    
    I mean, how many people really stick with "A Brief History of Time" to the bitter end? I was reading through Hadley Wickham's [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) when I read Jordan's article and wondered ... how many people read this entire book? Or do they start and sort of fizzle out? So I wanted to look at the distribution of pull requests. Are they evenly distributed throughout the book or do they cluster in the early chapters?
    
This is a glorified note-to-self. It might be interesting to a few other people. But I presume a lot of experience with R and a full-on embrace of `%>%`, `dplyr`, etc.

### Oliver's open issues

Let's start with the easiest task: does have Oliver issues? If so, can we be more specific?

First, load packages. Install `gh` and `purrr` from GitHub, if necessary. `gh` is not on CRAN and `purrr` is under active development; I doubt my code code would work with CRAN version.

```{r}
# install_github("gaborcsardi/gh")
# install_github("hadley/purrr")
library(gh)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(purrr))
```

Use `gh()` to retrieve all of Oliver's public GitHub repositories.

```{r}
repos <- gh("/users/ironholds/repos", .limit = Inf)
length(repos)
```

Create a data frame with one row per repo and two variables.

  * `repo` = repository name. Use `purrr::map_chr()` to extract all elements named `name` from the repository list. The map functions are much like base `lapply()` or `vapply()`. There is a lot of flexibility around how to specify the function to apply over the input list. Here I use a shortcut: the character vector `"name"` is converted into an extractor function.
  * `issue` = list-column of the issues for each repository. Again, I use a map function, in this case to provide vectorization for `gh()`. I use a different shortcut: the `~` formula syntax creates an anonymous function on-the-fly, where `.x` stands for "the input".

```{r oliver-issue-data-frame, cache = TRUE}
iss_df <-
  data_frame(
    repo = repos %>% map_chr("name"),
    issue = repo %>%
      map(~ gh(repo = .x, endpoint = "/repos/ironholds/:repo/issues",
               .limit = Inf))
    )
str(iss_df, max.level = 1)
```

Create a decent display of how many open issue there are on each repo. I use `map_int()` to count the open issues for each repo and standard `dplyr` verbs to select, filter, and arrange. I'm not even bothering with `knitr::kable()` here because these experiments are definitely not about presentation.

```{r}
iss_df %>%
  mutate(n_open = issue %>% map_int(length)) %>%
  select(-issue) %>%
  filter(n_open > 0) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_open)) %>%
  print(n = nrow(.))
```

A clean script for this is available in [open-issue-count-by-repo.R](open-issue-count-by-repo.R).

### Pull requests on a repo

*Even though it was [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) that got me thinking about this, I first started playing around with [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz), which happens to have 50% fewer PRs than Advanced R. But I've done this for both books and present a script and figure for each at the end of this example.*

Load packages. Even more this time.

```{r}
library(gh)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(tidyr)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(purrr))
library(curl)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(readr))
```

Use `gh()` to retrieve all pull requests on [`hadley/r-pkgs`](https://github.com/hadley/r-pkgs).

```{r pr-list, cache = TRUE}
owner <- "hadley"
repo <- "r-pkgs"
pr_list <-
  gh("/repos/:owner/:repo/pulls", owner = owner, repo = repo,
     state = "all", .limit = Inf)
length(pr_list)
```

Define a little helper function that [won't be necessary forever](https://github.com/hadley/purrr/issues/110), but is useful below when we dig info out of `pr_list`.

```{r}
map_chr_hack <- function(.x, .f, ...) {
  map(.x, .f, ...) %>%
    map_if(is.null, ~ NA_character_) %>%
    flatten_chr()
}
```

Use `map_*()` functions to extract and data-frame-ize the potentially useful parts of the pull request list. I'm extracting much more than I ultimately use, which betrays how overly optimistic I was when I started. So far I can't figure out how to use the API to directly compare two commits, but I haven't given up yet.

```{r pr-df, cache = TRUE}
pr_df <- pr_list %>%
{
  data_frame(number = map_int(., "number"),
             id = map_int(., "id"),
             title = map_chr(., "title"),
             state = map_chr(., "state"),
             user = map_chr(., c("user", "login")),
             commits_url = map_chr(., "commits_url"),
             diff_url = map_chr(., "diff_url"),
             patch_url = map_chr(., "patch_url"),
             merge_commit_sha = map_chr_hack(., "merge_commit_sha"),
             pr_HEAD_label = map_chr(., c("head", "label")),
             pr_HEAD_sha = map_chr(., c("head", "sha")),
             pr_base_label = map_chr(., c("base", "label")),
             pr_base_sha = map_chr(., c("base", "sha")),
             created_at = map_chr(., "created_at") %>% as.Date(),
             closed_at = map_chr_hack(., "closed_at") %>% as.Date(),
             merged_at = map_chr_hack(., "merged_at") %>% as.Date())
}
pr_df
```

I want to know which files are affected by each PR. If I had all this stuff locally, I would do [something like this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1552340/how-to-list-the-file-names-only-that-changed-between-two-commits):

``` shell
git diff --name-only SHA1 SHA2
```

I have to emulate that with the GitHub API. It seems the [compare two commits feature](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/#compare-two-commits) only works for two branches or two tags, but not two arbitrary SHAs. Please enlighten me and answer [this question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26925312/github-api-how-to-compare-2-commits) if you know how to do this.

My current workaround is to get info on the diff associated with a pull request from its associated patch file. We've already stored these URLs in the `pr_df` data frame. You can read my rather hacky helper function, [`get_pr_affected_files_from_patch()`](get-pr-affected-files-from-patch.R), if you wish, but I'll just source it here.

```{r}
source("get-pr-affected-files-from-patch.R")
```

Add a list-column to the data frame of pull requests. It holds one data frame per PR, with info on the file changes. We use `map()` again and also use `dplyr` and `purrr` together here, in order to preserve association between the existing PR info and the modified files. *This takes around 4 minutes for me FYI.*

```{r fetch-and-parse-patch, cache = TRUE}
pr_df <- pr_df %>%
    mutate(pr_files = patch_url %>% map(get_pr_affected_files_from_patch))
```

Sanity check the `pr_files` list-column. First, look at an example element. We have one row per file and two variables: `file` and `diffstuff` (currently I do nothing with this but ...). Do all elements of the list-column have exactly two variables? What's the distribution of the number of rows? I expect to see that the vast majority of PRs affect exactly 1 file, because there are lots of typo corrections. 

```{r}
pr_df$pr_files[[69]]
pr_df$pr_files %>% map(dim) %>% do.call(rbind, .) %>% apply(2, table)
```

Simplify the list-column elements from data frame to character vector. Then use `tidyr::unnest()` to "explode" things, i.e. give each element its own row. Each row is now a file modified in a PR.

```{r}
nrow(pr_df)
pr_df <- pr_df %>%
  mutate(pr_files = pr_files %>% map("file")) %>%
  unnest(pr_files)
nrow(pr_df)
```

Write `pr_df` out to file, omitting lots of the variables I currently have no use for.

```{r}
pr_df %>%
  select(number, id, title, state, user, pr_files) %>%
  write_csv("r-pkgs-pr-affected-files.csv")
```

Here's a figure depicting how often each chapter has been the target of a pull request. I'm not adjusting for length of the chapter or anything, so take it with a huge grain of salt. But there's no obvious evidence that people read and edit the earlier chapters more. We like to make suggestions about Git apparently!.

I went through the same steps with all pull requests on [`hadley/adv-r`](https://github.com/hadley/adv-r), the repository for [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz).

Here's the same figure as above but for Advanced R. There's a stronger case for earlier chapters being targetted with PRs more often. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
